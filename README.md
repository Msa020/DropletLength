# DropletLength
In this project, we are interested in measuring the length of droplets at different experimetal conditions, e,g, flow rate of the fluid around the droplets.

We have collaboratively automated the experimets with a Python script, which is connected to a camera and syringe pump to push the fluids at a set flow rate. 

After the experiments, we should analyse the images recorde by camera. By image procesing, we detect the generated droplets and measure the their length.
