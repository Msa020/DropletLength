# DropletLength
In this project, we are interested in measuring the length of droplets at different experimetal conditions, e,g, flow rate of the fluid around the droplets.

We have collaboratively automated the desired experimets with a Python script, which is connected to a camera and syringe pumps to push the fluids at a set flow rate. 

After the experiments, we should analyse the images recorded by camera. By image procesing, we detect the generated droplets and measure their length.
